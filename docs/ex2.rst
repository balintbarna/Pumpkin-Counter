Exercise 2 - Segmentation
_________________________

Using the color information of the pixels, we can estimate if they are pumpkin or not.
The simplest way to do that is to check if the color values fall inside a predetermined range.

To get usable results, we need to choose the limits wisely.
We did that by looking at the histograms of the color channels in the original image.
In the ranges we used the mean +- one standard deviation.
